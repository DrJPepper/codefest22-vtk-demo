# Philly Codefest VTK Workshop

This is still a work in progress currently

## Installation

### Linux
Todo

### Mac
Todo

### Windows

I tried for a long time to get everything installed on Windows but got frustrated and gave up. The C++ and Python demo should theoretically run on windows; you'll need to install the following dependencies (not needed for JS demo of course):

- [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source) (install version 5.15.2)
- [Visual Studio (for its compiler)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases) (don't use this link to install it run `python -m pip install ninja` instead)
- [VTK](https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/-/blob/master/Documentation/dev/build.md) (there may be precompiled binaries I just didn't see any on a quick look at the VTK website)

## Running
Todo
